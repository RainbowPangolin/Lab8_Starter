Check Your Understanding 

1) Put automated tests of the recipe project in a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed/during pull requests so we can quickly apply the change if it doesn't break anything, or reject it if it breaks. 

2) No

4) Probably, since a max message length feature would probably be decomposed from the rest of the software
